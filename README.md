# Application-of-Deeplearning-on-Lightweight-Block-Cipher-PRESENT
The Project is based upon the idea to see if Machine Learning can observe some chance of prediction in totally random bits generated by Lightweight Block Cipher - PRESENT.  Datasets is created from 10 lac(64 bits each) and LSTM model is used to see if the next bits can be predicted or not. This project is done during DRDO training period and executed on Google Colaboratory.
